The feedback I got was about the debug ray lines, at first it wasnt showing up for me. However after the feedback I realised I could change the amount of seconds for the line to stay on screen. By chanigng this varibale it allowed me to fully analyse and comprehend actaully what was going on in my game scene. This was very useful because at first it was only 2 seconds by changing to 10 I can fully see all the line at own pace. Eventually there will be more lines and if they only last for 2 seconds each then I wont be able to fully analyse whats going on in my debug.
