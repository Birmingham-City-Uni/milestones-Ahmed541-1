By doing the steering behaviour lab I worked on the "How far to look ahead" this helped me realise how realistic movement AI can become. So instead of having a constant value you can use distance, Time to target and speed based variables to see how far you want your AI to look ahead.I have also learnt about the seek limitations as seek always move to target with max acceleration so by reducing speed when it gets closer to target, this makes it stop doing the spiral movement around target. Seek and flee, pursue and evade are all things I understand how to use now including arrival so I will look to try to learn about Wander and implement this in the steering behaviour lab.


By doing the BFS and DFS lab it really helped me understand the concept. I learn more by visually so by seeing what the code and theory is doing I can have good grasp on the topic. The implementaion has helped me understand that it really isnt hard to implement the pseudo code and there is not much difference between the two. DFS is a stack and BFS is queue.

The feedback I got was about the debug ray lines, at first it wasnt showing up for me. However after the feedback I realised I could change the amount of seconds for the line to stay on screen. By chanigng this varibale it allowed me to fully analyse and comprehend actaully what was going on in my game scene. This was very useful because at first it was only 2 seconds by changing to 10 I can fully see all the line at own pace. Eventually there will be more lines and if they only last for 2 seconds each then I wont be able to fully analyse whats going on in my debug.
